# ShoppingCart
This Java project implements a dynamic shopping cart system capable of managing grocery items like fruits, vegetables, and canned goods. It uses object-oriented principles with an ItemInfo interface to ensure all items provide essential methods for cost calculation and identification. Classes like Fruit, Vegetables, and CannedItem implement this interface to handle specific item behaviors. The Cart class manages these items, supporting adding, removing, and displaying functions, along with total cost calculations. It also incorporates serialization to save and restore the cart's contents, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
